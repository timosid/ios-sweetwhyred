# Automatic CPU display candidate

System100 descends from the verified System95 image and adds a mobile launchd
job for fresh CPU captures. On boot99/System95, the exact signed candidate passed
finite capture and changing-scene pilots. The user confirmed both the Apple logo
and a temporary red marker on the panel. A working SpringBoard interface and
long-run memory stability remain unverified.

The final scene pilot captured39 frames in40.16s with0 errors and2 pixel-hash
changes. Three separate40s rounds captured38,39,39 frames with0 errors. Wired
memory samples after the rounds were15966,16001,16042 pages (16KiB/page). This is
a short observation, not a long-run leak proof. The permanent live binary remains
SHA256 `27b343c3e92384be4b7e2c0a50de32d228c1424865a4648e647f5c76eb28e4d1`;
the separate ten-second marker binary is not installed as the display job.

## Image contents

The candidate adds `/usr/local/whyred/bin/whyred-display`, the optional manual
`whyred-display-wake` tool, and
`/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.whyred.display.plist`. It adds the same job to
the embedded `/System/Library/xpc/launchd.plist` cache. All531 existing jobs,
including disabled bluetoothd/FairPlay, are retained. Existing SSH files and keys
must compare byte-for-byte with95; no keys or images belong in this repository.

The display job runs `whyred-display live` as mobile in the system bootstrap,
with a30s restart throttle. Every iteration obtains a new real LCD capture into
new IOSurface storage, queues it through the existing guarded AppleCLCD ABI and
releases the userspace reference. The kernel owns queued references. It does not
rewrite a surface still being presented. Each iteration has an autorelease pool;
three consecutive failures exit unsuccessfully. A stuck capture terminates after
45s so launchd can restart the process. Updates are limited to at most1fps;
actual speed must be measured on the phone.

The job writes `/private/var/mobile/Library/Logs/whyred-display.log`, whose parent
is seeded501:501 in RAMFS. The process limits regular files to1MiB and ignores
SIGXFSZ, allowing frame updates to continue after the journal cap. Sparse records
include frame/error/change counts, pixel hash and capture time. This is separate
from the Mac's ongoing UDP console log. No permanent display power override is
added; the wake executable is installed for explicit manual tests only.

## Required device pilot

1. Test the already packaged boot99 storage candidate with System95 first.
   The new bounded FIFO-ready recheck has full CI/host proofs, with an initial hardware pilot completed. Confirm the exact99 kernel UUID in a fresh SSH session.
2. Upload the exact signed live, wake and diagnostic binaries and read them back
   byte-for-byte. Do not reuse an outstanding98 SSH command/session.
3. Run the finite `live-window` as mobile using the explicit
   `whyreddiag run-mobile-display /absolute/executable live-window` command.
   Its fixed90s parent limit accommodates the40s pilot and final bounded capture.
   General `run-mobile` remains30s; the extended mode rejects continuous `live`.
4. Require normal child exit, at least3 clean fresh captures, no errors, and
   review memory before/after, measured capture latency and USB/storage records.
   A static logo can produce equal hashes; it does not establish changing-frame
   delivery. Verify a real scene change and visible output separately. Do not
   treat the private pilot receipt as an automatic deployment approval.
5. Only after the finite test and continued memory/visible checks pass, deploy
   the enabled System image. Retain the verified95 image and boot98 rollback.

## Offline validation

`tools/prepare-whyred-display-image.py --self-test` checks preservation of the
existing job cache and rejects conflicting jobs or changed service policy. The
full builder authenticates the prior images, overlay sources, signed tool
reports/rights/platform/ISA and embedded bootstrap paths. It writes no device.

New file bytes and metadata are checked through the independent read-only XNU
APFS core. `tools/whyred-display-image-compare.c` compares all old files, symlinks
and metadata, allowing exactly3 additions and a single explicit cache-content
exception. Only the two expected parent directory counts may increase. It rejects
deletions, unexpected additions, changed old bytes/modes and wrong new modes.
The image must fit the existing System partition; no partition layout changes.

Offline checks cannot establish capture timing, bounded surface lifetime on the
device, competition with stock swaps, or boot-time launchd behavior. The enabled
image remains a candidate until those measurements pass.

## Verified offline artifact,2026-11-04

Private `graphics-v100/system-v100-candidate` contains the completed5386194944B
image, SHA256 `622ca50416c4d296f846cd7d4e754ca2f1d87a8bfe122010fb588ef6eb40e5c8`.
Independent comparison passed8614114504 old logical bytes across45744 old files,
16607 directories and671 symlinks. Exactly3 files are added and only the existing
launchd cache contents are excepted; the cache is separately compared in full
with just the one intended job added. All four overlay byte/metadata checks pass.
The spool was removed after successful verification. Final code commit65b1e97
passed all CI41781693532/job126414466903 steps. The offline receipt describes build-time checks; it does not establish boot-time
launchd behavior. See the latest NOTES.md handoff for installation and device
validation state. Retain the verified System95 image for rollback.

## First automatic startup and memory-policy correction

System100 was installed successfully (all81 writes and reboot confirmed) with
boot99 retained. The first launchd job repeatedly reached live-begin but was
terminated before its first frame: SIGKILL, OS_REASON_JETSAM1,
JETSAM_REASON_MEMORY_PERPROCESSLIMIT7. The user still sees console text. Thus
successful finite manual captures did not validate the service's launchd budget.

The opt-in101 builder adds only `org.whyred.display` under
`Version4/Daemon/Override` in the existing D22 jetsam-properties file, with finite
128MiB active/inactive hard limits. All old530 daemon overrides, defaults, other
process classes and existing launchd jobs must remain equal. This is an
experimental budget pending on-device limits/footprint measurements; it is not
an allocation, a global jetsam change or a disabled fatal limit. The live binary
and its entitlements remain unchanged. Without `--display-memory-mb 128`, the builder retains100 behavior.

The read-only image comparator accepts the extra D22 file-content exception
only with `--display-memory-policy`; metadata and all other old file contents
remain checked. The builder separately compares the full policy dictionary and
the exact installed replacement bytes. A101 image must still pass full image
comparison and an automatic startup/device pilot before it is called working.

The completed101 candidate is5386182656B, SHA256
`ac49c87fb422b11cc9fc03f201db2c80eb457f91efad6a04e65a16743f392ff1`.
The independent reader compared8614013385 old logical bytes, with exactly3
additions and2 explicit changed-file exceptions; all5 overlay byte/metadata
checks passed. The D22 policy preserves all530 existing overrides and other
fields. All81 sparse packets and exact image reconstruction passed preflight.
It was subsequently installed successfully: all81 System writes and reboot were
confirmed. Boot99 remains installed. The automatic startup hardware test is
running; successful new frame progression is still pending. The OS's
Jetsam ips independently confirms per-process-limit at719 reported16KiB pages;
it does not state the exact configured threshold. No new signed program is
required for this candidate: it retains the authenticated live27b executable.
