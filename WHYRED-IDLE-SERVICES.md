# Idle interrupt-stack repair and service diagnostics

The v82 UART panic is `preemption count not 0`, count 1, in kernel_task tid 102.
Its kernel UUID matches the installed v82 binary. Symbolication places the check
in the ARM64 user-return path, rather than inside a daemon. Thread creation order
identifies tid 102 as the boot CPU idle thread; idle deliberately holds one
preemption-disable reference. The panic text alone does not identify the original
instruction or prove which saved state was corrupted.

Patch 0120 introduced an unsafe combination: `Idle_context` switches to
CPU_ISTACKPTR, then the proximate-timer wait unmasks IRQs there. An IRQ allocates
its saved state below the interrupted SP, but SWITCH_TO_INT_STACK resets the
handler SP to that same interrupt-stack top. Handler calls can overwrite both
the live idle frames and the exception saved state. This is a concrete stack
ownership defect consistent with the observed idle-thread user-return assertion.

Patch 0163 replaces only that SWEET timer wait with a pending-interrupt loop
using DSB SY and WFI while preserving DAIF. WFI can wake for a signaled pending
IRQ without taking its handler while PSTATE.I is set. GIC priority/group enables
stay unchanged. The pending interrupt is handled after Idle_load_context restores
the thread stack. Spurious WFI returns are rechecked. The ordinary thread-stack
unmasked WFE recommendation path remains valid. The preemption assertion is kept.
See the [Linux ARM64 idle sequence](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.1/arch/arm64/kernel/idle.c)
for the same masked-WFI approach and its interrupt-controller priority caveat.
Physical wakeup and absence of the reported panic still require a device run.

The supplied full UART contains repeated `exec bluetoothd` and `exec fairplayd.H2`
without their exit causes; a later tail adds repeated suggestd. Those exec lines
precede completion. The full capture first exhausts the 8192-page RAMFS quota
before its first pkd attempt, while bluetoothd/fairplayd repeats already occur
before quota exhaustion. The separate lsd SIGSEGV is a userspace crash. These
observations do not establish a common daemon failure cause.

Patch 0164 adds default-off `whyred-service-trace=1` for exactly bluetoothd,
fairplayd.H2, suggestd, lsd and pkd. `WHYRED SERVICE` prints ticks, fixed target
name, PID, event, sequence, errno, detail, raw wait status and OS reason namespace/
64-bit code. Exec/spawn detail means image activation completed; it does not
prove userspace initialization. Exit detail means internal posix_spawn failure.
Decode exit status with Darwin wait macros: e.g. 0x100 is normal exit 1; 0xb is
signal 11. Exit reporting runs once in proc_exit, after unlocking and before
reference cleanup, including direct task-termination paths.

Each target/event has a saturating atomic 64-record budget: at most 960 records
across both translation units. There are no allocations, user-memory reads,
path lookups or reason-buffer parsing. The hooks keep live process references
and print outside proc locks. Jobs, KeepAlive policies and return values are
unchanged. Errors occurring before a target process name is assigned are outside
this diagnostic's coverage. This patch diagnoses the daemon loops; it does not
claim to repair their unknown exit causes.

`tools/test-whyred-idle-services.py` runs the actual wait and reporting helpers
with modeled interrupts/kernel services. It covers already-pending interrupts,
16 spurious wakeups, mask/barrier ordering, disabled and malformed configuration,
exact target selection, event fields, 64-bit reason codes, saturation and 8000
concurrent report attempts. Assembly and hook-placement contracts are checked.
Local UBSan passes 799 checks; all three changed ARM64 units compile with zero
LSE/PAN instructions. Restoring the unmasked timer call or weakening the output
budget fails a negative control. Host tests do not emulate real GIC wakeup or
kernel stack execution. Full CI41329547329 subsequently passed all27 steps, including799 ASan+UBSan
checks, retained USB614/RAMFS1120134 and the complete ARM64 build. Downloaded
artifacts match provenance, digest, length and CRC. Packaged linked cpu_idle
contains the pending-IRQ/DSB/WFI wait with no DAIFClr; runtime sources match the
reviewed files. The verified v85 image remains unflashed. Device wakeup, stability
and service exit observations are the next required evidence.
